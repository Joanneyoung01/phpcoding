# Final Year Project 

For my final year project at Leeds University, I wanted to build a system that could help the local jobs market link students to ad hoc jobs in and around Leeds Area.

As a student, 
So that I can earn extra cash
I would like to be able to find Jobs on the Leeds Student Jobs board

As restaurant owner
So that I can operate my business
I would like to find local students that can work part time/adhoc in my restaurant
